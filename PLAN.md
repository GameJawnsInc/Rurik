# Rurik — the hardened plan

**Companion to [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md), which it corrects rather than replaces.** Written
2026-08-04 from a nine-agent recon sweep, three adversarial critiques, two focused
reverse-engineering passes, and direct measurement of the local install and the mirrored prior art.

HANDOFF.md's *strategy* survives intact: the live game is the donor, archaeology beats invention,
capture is a wasting asset, the defect follows the authorship, and Pre-Searing is the finish line.
Its *mechanism* does not. Nearly every implementation choice in §3, §4, §5 and §7 was made against
a picture of the field that turns out to be four years stale.

Confidence is marked throughout. **[measured]** means this session verified it directly against
`C:\gw` or a mirrored repo. **[sourced]** means a cited primary source. **[probe]** means it is a
hypothesis with a specific experiment attached, and it is not yet a fact.

---

## 1. What changed, ranked by impact

### 1.1 The field is not dead. It is the most active it has been in a decade.

HANDOFF.md §1 and §4: *"roughly fifteen years of intermittent community attempts (GWLP-R in Java,
sgwlpr in Scala) produced zero playable outcomes."* This is the load-bearing premise for the whole
"R4 is pure authorship, and that is fatal" argument. It is wrong.

| Project | What it is | State **[measured]** |
|---|---|---|
| [gw-preservation/server](https://github.com/gw-preservation/server) | A GW1 **server in Go** — the most advanced effort in the field | pushed **2026-08-04 19:07 UTC**, i.e. hours before this was written. **No license = all rights reserved.** |
| [ldufr/OpenTyria](https://github.com/ldufr/OpenTyria) | A working GW1 **server** in C | 180 commits, last 2026-02-21, **Unlicense (public domain)**, ~25,630 lines of real code |
| [ldufr/Headquarter](https://github.com/ldufr/Headquarter) | A GW1 **headless client** in C | MIT, 496 commits, pushed 2026-07-11, tracking live builds to 38688 |
| [gw-preservation/network-logger](https://github.com/gw-preservation/network-logger) | Drop-in DLL logging **100% of game↔client traffic** | pushed 2026-07-25. No license. |
| [apoguita/Py4GW_Reforged](https://github.com/apoguita/Py4GW_Reforged) | Live successor to Py4GW | pushed **2026-08-04 19:53 UTC**. No license. (`apoguita/Py4GW`, 68★, was **archived 2026-07-21**.) |
| [Fournux/Tyria-Extractor](https://github.com/Fournux/Tyria-Extractor) | `Gw.dat` → skills/items/quests/NPCs, plus a sniffer | **MIT**, Rust, created 2026-06-30 |
| [gwdevhub/GWToolboxpp](https://github.com/gwdevhub/GWToolboxpp) | The in-client toolbox | 872★, MIT, pushed **2026-08-04** |
| [build-wars/gw-skilldata](https://github.com/build-wars/gw-skilldata) | Community skill dataset | MIT, pushed **2026-08-04** |

Four repositories were pushed to on the day this plan was written, two of them within the hour. The
`gw-preservation/server` tree carries **397 map definitions** (essentially the whole game), a real
`Gw.dat` trapezoid navmesh with A* and line-of-sight, working map portals with spawn coordinates,
character creation, dye, emotes and cartography, plus a from-scratch TLS-SRP portal — with commits
like `fix world/movement tick sync` and `trap pathing impl` landing this week. It pins
`clientVersion == 37600`, a **pre-Reforged** build, which is its one significant limitation.

`entice` (the GWLP-R successor org) is genuinely dead — last activity 2016 **[measured]** — so the
handoff's pessimism was accurate *as of about 2016* and has not been revisited since.

**But the sober conclusion survives, for a better reason than the handoff gives.** At least four
independent projects have driven a real client to character select, into a map, and moving:
GWLP-R (2012–13), entice (2015–16), OpenTyria, and gw-preservation. **Nobody has ever built R4.**
No combat, no skill engine, no AI, no spawns — not in fifteen years, not in any repo any of this
research could find. `entice/skill`, whose description was "Defines skills. All of them.", is
marked DEPRECATED. That precedent lands *precisely* on Rurik's actual deliverable, which makes it
a sharper warning than the one HANDOFF.md gives, not a weaker one.

**Consequence, stated carefully:** R1–R3 drop from research to transcription, because working
reference implementations exist for all three. R4 remains exactly as hard as the handoff feared —
and it is now unambiguously *the* project, rather than the last third of it.

**License discipline matters here.** OpenTyria is public domain and Headquarter is MIT, so both are
freely usable. `gw-preservation/*` and `Py4GW_Reforged` carry **no license at all**, which means
all rights reserved: read them, learn from them, cite them — never copy from them.

### 1.2 The packet catalog already exists, in the public domain

HANDOFF.md §5: *"Extract the packet catalog into a machine-readable schema and codegen from that
one source. Hand-maintaining three parallel copies of 400+ packet definitions is how this project
dies of paper cuts."* Correct instinct. Already done by someone else.

OpenTyria's `code/msgdefs.c` is a declarative message-schema table **[measured]**:

| Direction | Count |
|---|---|
| `AUTH_CMSG` (client → auth) | 57 |
| `AUTH_SMSG` (auth → client) | 39 |
| `GAME_CMSG` (client → game) | 194 |
| `GAME_SMSG` (game → client) | **487** |
| **Total** | **777** |

Each entry is a field list over a 15-type vocabulary: `MSG_HEADER`, `DWORD`, `WORD`, `BYTE`,
`FLOAT`, `STRING_16`, `AGENT_ID`, `BLOB`, `VECT2`, `VECT3`, `ARRAY_8/16/32`, `NESTED_STRUCT`.
`GameMsg.h` and `AuthMsg.h` add 84 and 24 hand-typed C structs on top.

Two things make this decisive. First, **Unlicense means public domain** — there is no license
friction at all, unlike GWCA. Second, the 487 game-server messages **independently match Py4GW's
separately-reported 487 StoC headers**, which is real cross-validation from two unrelated projects
against the current client.

**But the real authority is inside the client, and nobody has ever read it.** The client
deserializes with a table of `{uint32_t *packet_template; uint32_t template_size; handler_func}`
against `STOC_HEADER_COUNT = 0x1e5` (485) **[sourced — GWCA's `StoCMgr_old.cpp`]**. GWCA resolves
that pointer, asserts the count, and then uses **only `handler_func`** — the loop over
`packet_template` was never written. The tag encoding is documented by working code in GWLP-R-Utils'
`PacketTemplate Dumper`, and the type system it describes has sized integers, 1–3 floats, opaque
handles, fixed blobs, UTF-16 strings and length-prefixed arrays, with **no unions, no bitfields and
no conditional layouts** — because the client's generic deserializer cannot express them. That
settles the schema-language design question with evidence rather than speculation, and it matches
OpenTyria's 15-type vocabulary closely enough to be the same discovery arrived at twice.

This matters because four corpora disagree about what the catalog even is: GWLP-R has 773 ID slots
with 252 named, its dumper reported 752, GWCA names 217 StoC with 123 structs, OpenTyria defines
487 game-server messages, and Py4GW observes 487 live. Codegen off the wrong one and you find out
when fixtures fail, after the schema has calcified. **The client's own `template_size` is the
arbiter**, and any external corpus that disagrees with it is a *mechanically detectable* defect —
which makes the whole reconciliation job safely delegable to agents.

**Consequence:** HANDOFF §5's codegen plan keeps its architecture and loses its input problem.
Dump the client's template table, use it as truth, and treat OpenTyria's 777 definitions as the
naming and cross-check layer.

### 1.2b The capture hook point in §11 step 4 cannot produce raw bytes

HANDOFF §3 says hooking StoC dispatch yields "decrypted, framed, already-typed messages, which is
strictly better than pcap," and §11 step 4 says to write "framed, timestamped **raw** packets."
Those are incompatible. GWCA's hook swaps `handler_func` in the dispatch table, so what it receives
is an **already-deserialized struct** whose arrays and strings are pointers elsewhere. A
`memcpy(pak, sizeof(T))` truncates every variable-length field in the game — silently, for a year,
into an irreplaceable vault. Worse, the typed-callback API has no catch-all, so an opcode with no
mapped struct is *invisible* rather than merely unparsed, which is strictly worse than pcap for
exactly the packets you most want bytes of.

**Fix: hook twice.** A low hook at the post-decrypt receive boundary feeds the byte vault — the
irreplaceable artifact. A high hook at dispatch feeds a typed sidecar. The plaintext boundary is
named in this build: `MsgConn.cpp`, `MSGCONN_MODE_ENCRYPTED` and `DispatchStream` are all present
in `Gw.exe` **[measured]**. R0's acceptance criterion then becomes a real instrument calibration
rather than a test of your file I/O: *the struct stream I parse from raw bytes equals the struct
stream the client built, field for field, across a whole session.*

### 1.3 Reforged shipped an official WebAssembly client, and it is a far better RE target

Nothing in HANDOFF.md knows this. ArenaNet re-platformed Guild Wars onto a portable C++ core that
builds to Win32-x86, WebAssembly, and mobile. The artifacts are `Gw.wasm`, `Gw.js`,
`Gw.jspi.wasm`, `Gw.jspi.js`, fetched from `patching.1.arenanetworks.com` **[measured — all four
filenames and the CDN host appear throughout the mirrored `shiburito/gw_in_browser` tree, and
`jean-humann/gwnative` hard-requires all four]**.

Local corroboration: `Gw.exe` references `libEGL.dll` and `libGLESv2.dll` (ANGLE) and imports no
Direct3D at all **[measured]**, which is exactly the renderer you build to target Emscripten.
`C:\gw\THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md` lists only four dependencies — `jsmn`, `OpenAL-Soft`, `PFFFT`,
`stb_image` — a deliberately portable, dependency-light core.

Why this matters: a WASM module is a structured, typed format with explicit control flow and no
register allocation, so it decompiles far better than x86. `gw_in_browser` ships `wasmscan.py`,
`wasmdetour.py`, `wasmpatch.py` and `gensyms.py` **[measured — present in the mirror]**, reporting
full decode of all 17,596 functions and detour capability across them **[sourced, not reproduced]**.

**Two corrections, because the first version of this section overstated the case.** The shipped
module is **stripped** — no `name` section. What survives is better than nothing but weaker than
symbols: string literals are byte-identical to the `.exe` (same source tree), and ~850 original
source paths persist in `.data` (`../../../../Gw/Ui/UiRoot.cpp`), so `gensyms.py` *reconstructs*
per-function attribution rather than reading it off. Separately, the fully-mangled C++ names that
Py4GW works from appear to come from an **earlier, archived build** that shipped with its `name`
section intact — its function count is 18,004 against today's 17,596. Chunks are content-addressed
and retained while referenced, so retrieving that symbol-bearing build is plausible but unproven.

**And a posture warning that outranks the technical upside.** These browser harnesses reach
ArenaNet production using a shared client key lifted from the Android APK, `gw_in_browser` cannot
log in at all (its `login`/`secureStorage` paths are stubs, making it a **static-RE tool, not a
live-capture one**), and `gwdevhub/gw_in_browser` is now 404 with no stated reason. This is the
riskiest area in this document and it sits badly against HANDOFF §9's "local and personal only"
posture. Treat the WASM path as an *offline analysis* asset — which is where its real value is
anyway — and do not build the live capture story on it.

**Consequence:** HANDOFF §5's *"capture harness — C++, because it must live inside the client next
to GWCA"* is still the wrong default, but the replacement is A1 below, not the browser.

### 1.4 GWCA is no longer an open dependency

HANDOFF.md §4 calls GWCA *"your most valuable external asset."* As a runtime dependency it is not
available. `GregLando113/GWCA` has been **archived read-only since 2023-11-14** **[measured]**, and
there is no `gwdevhub/GWCA` — that path 404s **[measured]**. The maintained GWCA is closed-source,
vendored into GWToolboxpp as a prebuilt DLL, import library and headers.

**Consequence:** downgrade GWCA from *dependency* to *dictionary*. Its named opcodes and typed
structs remain the best naming corpus in the field. Do not plan to build on its DLL.

### 1.5 R1 is not patch-free — verified against your own binary this session

**This is now measured, not argued.** `toolkit/clientscan/dump_dh_params.py` locates the pinned
Diffie-Hellman parameter struct in `C:\gw\Gw.exe` by the accessor signature that Headquarter's
`dump_key.py` (which reads it) and OpenTyria's `patch-gw.py` (which writes it) both use — two
independent implementations that agree. Result on our pinned build **[measured]**:

```
match at file 0x003d7523 -> struct VA 0x00a843e8 (RVA 0x6843e8, section .rdata)
  word0 = 1     generator g = 4     prime p = 512 bits     server public B = 509 bits
  all shape checks pass
```

The scheme is static-ephemeral Diffie-Hellman in which **the server's public value B is never
transmitted** — the client already has it compiled in and derives the shared secret locally as
`B^a mod p`. A server we control cannot reproduce that secret without `b`, the discrete log of B,
which ArenaNet never shipped and which a 512-bit discrete log puts out of scope. So the client's
`(g, p, B)` triple **must** be replaced with one whose private exponent we hold.

**HANDOFF.md §4's "R1 needs no binary patching" is therefore falsified against our own binary,
not merely on someone else's authority.** `-authsrv` gets the client to connect to us; without the
patch the stream is undecryptable. `patch-gw.py` additionally NOPs a `CreateMutexA` check and
renames the mutex, which is what allows multiple client instances — directly useful for capture at
scale. Budget a client-patching step permanently, including redoing it after every ArenaNet build.

The parameters themselves are ArenaNet-derived and were written to `vault/keys/`, never the repo.

### 1.5b Why this was worth doing before touching the network

HANDOFF.md §4: *"`-authsrv <ip>` ... R1 needs no binary patching."* The flag is real — it is the
first entry in a contiguous, alphabetically sorted 41-entry argument table at file offset
`0x005371cc` in `Gw.exe` **[measured]**. But `Gw.exe`'s `.rdata` also carries a pinned 136-byte
crypto blob: two header words plus two 64-byte high-entropy values, being the Diffie-Hellman
modulus and **the server's public key**. Because the server's public key is baked into the client,
no server you control can key the auth channel without patching it. OpenTyria's `tools/patch-gw.py`
does exactly this.

**Consequence:** R1 acquires a patched-client build step, and the patched binary is a derived
ArenaNet artifact that belongs in the vault, never the repo.

### 1.6 Login is three stages, and `-authsrv` reaches only the middle one

```
Stage A  PORTAL    HTTP(S) + XML  ->  account.arena.net / webgate.ncplatform.net   <- -portal
Stage B  AUTHSRV   DH + ARC4      ->  Auth1.ArenaNetworks.com:6112                 <- -authsrv
Stage C  GAMESRV   DH + ARC4      ->  address handed over by Stage B               <- no flag
```

The best news in this document is buried here: **setting `-portal` makes the client use port 6601,
prefix every request path with `/Spawned/WebGate`, and turn its TLS flag off.** A local Stage A
therefore needs no certificate, no trust-store surgery and no SRP — just an HTTP server answering
four XML endpoints. That is why OpenTyria's `webgate.py` is a couple of hundred lines of standard
library.

Two corrections fall out of this, both recorded in [studies/handshake/PLAN.md](studies/handshake/PLAN.md):
`GwLoginClient.dll` is **not** on the client's login path (it is NCSoft's SRP stack, used by
third-party launchers; `Gw.exe` never calls it), and `-portaldll` is **dead code** — parsed into a
buffer that nothing reads. Both were promising leads earlier in this session and both were killed
by checking the call graph instead of the string table.

### 1.7 Much of the "server-only" data ships in the client

HANDOFF.md §1 and §3 assert that skill effects, AI, spawns, drops and quest logic *"lived only on
ArenaNet's machines."* Substantially overstated. `GW::Skill` is a 160-byte static client-side
structure carrying `energy_cost`, `adrenaline`, `activation`, `aftercast`, `recharge`,
`duration0`/`duration15`, `scale0`/`scale15`, `bonusScale0`/`bonusScale15` and `aoe_range`
**[sourced — GWCA `Include/GWCA/GameEntities/Skill.h`]**. The two-point rank-scaling model that R4b
most needs is readable without a server and without a capture. Zone metadata (`AreaInfo`), walkable
geometry (`PathingMap`/`PathingTrapezoid`, also derivable offline from `Gw.dat`), and NPC identity
are likewise client-side.

What genuinely remains server-only, on the evidence: absolute monster HP, energy and armor (GWCA
comments `AgentLiving.hp` as a percentage and marks `max_hp`/`max_energy` "only works for
yourself"), spawn placement, drop tables, and AI decision logic. **Four things, not a whole game.**

**Consequence:** the capture campaign gets much more sharply targeted. Capture what is genuinely
server-only; extract the rest.

### 1.8 There *was* a server binary, and the client is one half of its source tree

HANDOFF.md §1 opens *"There is no server binary. There never was one to have."* The first sentence
is true of what we can hold. The second is false, and correcting it changes the shape of the work.

`Gw.exe` carries **937 distinct `P:\Code\…` source paths** — ArenaNet's own build-machine paths,
left in the image by `assert()` and a few other macros **[measured, on both vaulted builds]**. Every
gameplay subsystem in them sits under a client marker: `Gw\Char\Cli\ChCliApi.cpp`,
`Gw\Item\Cli\ItCliApi.cpp`, `Gw\Party\Cli\PyCliParty.cpp`, `Gw\Main\MainCli.cpp`. **Twelve
subsystems ship a `Cli` half and nothing else**, and **no path in either image lies under a `Srv\`
directory** — six spellings checked, zero hits, on two builds four months apart. The linker's own
PDB path agrees from the other side: `P:\Code\.build\target\Gw\vs2022\builder_x32\bin\Gw.pdb`, one
`.build` with a directory per target.

So the client and the server were **two build targets over one source tree**, and the shipped client
is the `Cli` half. That is a materially better position than inventing from nothing, because it says
exactly which of ArenaNet's code we can read: `Base\`, `Engine\`, `Net\` and `Gw\Const\` carry no
Cli/Srv split at all, so both targets compiled them. `Net\Msg\` is the transport both ends spoke —
which is why §1.2's message-table dump worked. `Engine\Agent\` is the agent *model* (the client's
own `Gw\AgentView\` is only its rendering), and `Engine\Map\Path\` is R3's authority.

**Consequence:** "reconstruct the server binary" is the wrong target and always was. The right one
is the `Srv` half of `P:\Code`, which decomposes into transport (recovered), constants (readable),
agent model and pathing (readable, shared engine), and twelve subsystem halves — narrowed further by
§1.7's four genuinely server-only behaviours. Full census, method and limits:

## 2. The go/no-go probes

Ordered by information gained per unit cost. Probes 1 and 2 need a human at the keyboard — an agent
session cannot launch `Gw.exe` on this machine.

**Probe 0 — the DH parameter struct.** ✅ **Done this session.** No network, no launch, thirty
minutes. It validated the entire R1 approach against our own build and settled the patching
question. Re-run it after every ArenaNet update — if the signature stops matching, no published
patching tool can be trusted until it is re-derived, and that is a real finding rather than a tool
failure:

```bash
python toolkit/clientscan/dump_dh_params.py
```

**Probes 1 and 2 — the auth handshake.** ✅ **Done. Both a GO.** Full result and byte-level
decode: [studies/handshake/PLAN.md](studies/handshake/PLAN.md) §0.

The portal is **plaintext HTTP on 6601**, exactly as predicted — the client sends
`GET /Spawned/WebGate/session/create.xml HTTP/1.1` with `Authorization: Arena 0`, no TLS anywhere.
That single request is the specification for our webgate. AuthSrv on 6112 speaks the documented
Diffie-Hellman opening: a hello carrying the build number, then header `0x4200` followed by 64
bytes of `A = g^a mod p`, with the generator `4` matching the value read out of `.rdata`. The
client speaks first on both sockets, and `Code=058` after a successful connection is the *correct*
outcome of a listener that never replies.

Two things fell out that were not being looked for. The build number rides in the clear on every
session (`User-Agent: Gw/38797.0 (Win32)`), which answers HANDOFF §9's unaddressed question of how
to stamp a build id into capture manifests. And the client hit **6112 before 6601**, so the three
stages are not a strict sequential chain — do not assume the portal must complete before the auth
socket opens.

**Probe 3 — does the WASM client boot and survive instrumentation?** *(days, agent-farmable)*
Fetch the four artifacts, run `wasmscan.py` and `gensyms.py` from the mirrored `gw_in_browser`,
open the result in Chrome DevTools. **Success looks like** recognisable C++ symbols attributed to
source paths. This single probe decides whether the harness is C++ or Python/JS, which is the
largest remaining architectural fork.

**Probe 4 — does OpenTyria build and accept a client?** *(days)*
Build it, seed the SQLite database, generate DH params, patch a *copy* of the client, run
`webgate.py`, connect. **Success is a character standing in a map on your own server** — HANDOFF's
R2, in week one instead of year one. Even total failure is cheap and teaches you the stack.

**Probe 5 — is `-mock` anything?** ❌ **Answered NO, statically, no launch needed.** It selects a
mock *graphics device*. Exactly three strings in the image contain "mock" — `mockDevice` (ASCII),
the flag `mock`, and `MockDevice` sitting in a run of window names (`BtnExit`, `BtnRestore`,
`BtnMin`, `Game`, `UiRoot`) — and the single assert site naming it is `MainCli:176 mockDevice`,
inside `Gw\Main\MainCli.cpp`'s argument handling **[measured]**. There is no offline mode and no
mock server. Salvage: a null render device belongs on the capture-arc list next to `-noui`,
`-nosound` and the mutex NOP, for running many clients at once.

## 3. The revised ladder

**This table is the project's single status authority.** `CLAUDE.md` and `RUNBOOK.md`
point here and do not restate it. That rule exists because on 2026-08-06 the three
documents asserted three different current positions, the newest of them 40 hours stale,
and a cold agent session reads whichever it opens first. If you land a rung, date it and
stamp it with a commit hash **in the same commit**; if you cannot, the rung is not landed.

| Rung | Deliverable | Acceptance criterion | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **R0a** | Vault + provenance gate + prior-art mirrors | A capture replays byte-identically from disk | ✅ **2026-08-04** — gate proven both directions, client pinned and hash-verified, prior art mirrored. *Caveat: closed against three facts, none of which is the stated criterion — nothing has ever read a `.raw` back. See §3.1.* |
| **R1** | Handshake against a local server | Client reaches character select | ✅ **2026-08-04 22:58**, `e34c417`. Build 38797 rendered "Test Warrior" against our portal, our DH parameters, our ARC4 channel and our login burst. |
| **R2** | Presence | Your own body standing in a real map | ✅ **2026-08-05 11:15**, `aedc214`. |
| **R3** | Movement on real geometry | You walk to a wall and are stopped | ✅ **2026-08-05 17:40**, `a97c7c4` — the server reads the game's own navmesh. Movement itself landed at `885d05d` (11:46). Estimated here as "a quarter, not a week"; it took six hours. |
| **R4a** | Agent model + combat core | An ettin swings at you and you die | 🔶 **half.** A hostile Hatcher stands in the map, and a click orders an attack the server drives to a kill and a revive (`f8320ff`, `37cb856`, 2026-08-06). **Nothing swings back and the player cannot die**, which is the half the criterion actually names. There is still no agent table — `studies/enemy/PLAN.md` §7.2. |
| **R4b** | The skill substrate | See §3.2 — rewritten as a count | 🔶 **started.** Eight real skills on the bar with correct tooltips (`70c3926`), the cast lifecycle read out of the client's own asserts, `USE_SKILL` answered. **No skill resolves an effect.** |
| **R4c** | AI + spawns + quests | See §3.2 — rewritten as a count | ⬜ not started. |
| **R5** | Declarative authoring toolkit | A new zone in TOML, hot-reloaded, walked | ⬜ not started — but its substrate exists as of `501698b`: `content/*.toml` and `toolkit/content.py`, with the server holding zero content literals. |
| **R0b** | **Instrumented-client capture** of a real session | A live session recorded from inside a client we control, both directions, stamped `origin: live` and byte-replayable from disk | ⬜ **not started, and it is the wasting asset.** Every capture in the vault is Rurik talking to Rurik; not one byte is ArenaNet's. **Re-specified 2026-08-06 — it used to read "proxy capture", which cannot work: the channel is DH-keyed end to end and a proxy holds neither private exponent. That is the same fact that forces us to patch the client for our own server.** Unblocked by §7 Q4. **The unpatched-DH build now exists** (`vault/client-patched-live/`, assembled at `vault/run-live/`, reproducible with `make_custom_client.py --no-dh-patch`, 2026-08-06) — so §6.2 item 1's *artifact* is done, but its *launch path* is not: nothing in the toolkit may start that binary, by design. Writing the driver that can is this rung's own first commit. |
| **R1.5** | **Tape player** | A recorded StoC stream replayed at recorded timing walks a real client through Ascalon | ⬜ not started. Requires R0b, so it inherits R0b's block. |

Two structural changes, both argued below in §4.

### 3.1 What "done" is doing in the table above

R0a is the honest wart and is marked rather than quietly re-worded. Its criterion is *a
capture replays byte-identically from disk*, and nothing in `toolkit/` has ever read a
`.raw` file back. What was actually achieved — the gate, the pinned client, the mirrors —
is worth having and is not what the row claimed. Either build the reader or restate the
criterion; do not leave a ✅ standing on a different fact.

The lesson generalises, and it is why the status column now carries hashes: **R2 and R3
were both landed and neither was recorded here for 40 hours**, while R3's own estimate
in this table ("a quarter, not a week") stayed in print through the six hours it actually
took. A ladder nobody updates stops being a control instrument in both directions at
once — it under-reports what is done and keeps mis-estimating what is next.

### 3.2 R4b and R4c, rewritten as counts

The old criteria could not be evaluated. R4b's was *"one skill from each mechanical
family resolves correctly"* and **"mechanical family" is enumerated nowhere in this
repo**. R4c's was *"an area populates and plays like the recording"* and **there is no
recording** — R0b has not been built, so that criterion referenced an artifact the plan
had deprioritised.

Both are now graded against an enumerated content surface:
[studies/presearing/MANIFEST.md](studies/presearing/MANIFEST.md).

- **R4b — *n* of **9**.** Pre-Searing's reachable skills span nine of the client's 21
  player-skill `type_code` families, and R4b is met when at least one named skill id in
  each resolves its effect correctly *against the client's own state* — not against our
  server agreeing with itself. The manifest names an exemplar per family (Frenzy 346,
  Flare 194, Healing Signet 1, Sever Artery 382, …). **Today n = 0.** Nine and not 21
  because the other twelve codes have no Pre-Searing content to test against; grading
  against 21 would grade v1 against non-v1 content.
- **R4c — split, because half of it is blocked and reporting one number hides which.**
  *R4c-1, capture-free*: 19 of 19 map rows with resolved file ids and arrival points that
  pass the spawn-in-trapezoid test (today 2), ≥15 NPC templates (today 1), 2 of 2
  mandatory quests completable, 6 of 6 quest verbs implemented, 4 of 4 services working.
  *R4c-2, capture-gated*: 35–40 monster types with real stats and skill bars, graded on
  **types, never on spawn instances** — spawn counts are unstatable from any source this
  project has. R4c-2 stays at 0 and is **reported as blocked until R0b exists**, which is
  a dependency rather than a failure and the ladder should show it as one.

**Carried in the criterion rather than buried:** five real mechanical families — Shout,
Interrupt, Well/Spirit/Trap/Ward, Block, Ritual — have **no** Pre-Searing exemplar at
all, and five more have exactly one. A green R4b therefore does not mean the skill engine
is general. That is the GW1 specialist's dissent from the 2026-08-06 review, now
quantified: you can finish v1 having proven very little about whether the engine can
drive a real Guild Wars fight. If generality matters it needs its own rung with a
post-Searing exemplar per absent family, and that is outside the declared v1 line.

*Both are proposals until the owner adopts them.* Two caveats travel with them. The
manifest's CLIENT numbers are strong and were re-derived independently here — 19 zone
rows at `continent == 1`, 1,333 player skills over 21 type codes. Its **WIKI numbers are
weaker than this repo's usual bar**: the browser route was unavailable for every pass, so
wiki figures came through search-engine prose rather than page reads, and the manifest
says so itself. Treat any wiki-only figure as approximate until re-read. And the manifest
raises one scope question no data can answer — whether "playable solo end to end" includes
the Ascalon Academy mission cluster and the hand-off into post-Searing, or stops at the
mission being completable.

**R0b replaces R0's C++ harness.** The capture harness stops being an in-process DLL. It does
**not** become a proxy — this section originally said it would, and that was wrong for a reason
this document establishes elsewhere and then failed to apply here: §1.5 and §1.6 record that the
auth and game channels are keyed by Diffie-Hellman between the client and the server, which is
precisely why *our* server cannot talk to a stock client without patching its parameters. A proxy
sits in the same position and holds neither private exponent, so it can relay ciphertext and read
none of it.

What R0b actually is: **a client we control, recording its own decrypted stream.** Headquarter's
headless-client approach (MIT, C, tracking live builds) is the instrument named in §4-A1, and
`gw-preservation/network-logger` is the in-client route to read for it. That keeps the property
the proxy idea was chosen for — it is not an in-process DLL hooking addresses that move with every
build — while being a thing that can exist.

**R1.5, the tape player, is new and it is the best idea to come out of this exercise.** Before
writing any simulating server, write a server that replays a recorded StoC stream at recorded
timing, fixing up only session-specific fields. It simulates nothing. It proves your framing, your
crypto, your opcode table and your session setup — the entire transport stack — against a real
client, with zero game logic written, and it produces a walkable-looking Ascalon months before
R4a. HANDOFF's R1→R2→R3 each require newly invented logic; the tape player collapses all three
into a replay problem you already have the data for.

---

## 4. Angles of attack, ranked

**A1 — Capture first, and do not write the harness from scratch.** *(days · mixed)*
The single largest schedule saving available. Two instruments already exist and they are
complementary rather than competing.

*A headless-client recorder*, following Headquarter's approach (MIT, C, tracking live builds to
38688). It needs no injection, no patched client and no GWToolbox, it runs unattended, and it can
be scripted to sweep maps — which turns the capture campaign from months of manual play into a
batch job. Headquarter is a complete from-scratch GW1 client that logs into live servers and is
already used in production by `gwdevhub/GuildWarsPartySearch` and `kamadanv2`. Adding framed,
timestamped raw-packet writing is roughly one function.

*An in-client sniffer*, for fidelity. `gw-preservation/network-logger` is a drop-in DLL that logs
100% of game-server↔client traffic to disk **[measured — mirrored]**, and `Fournux/Tyria-Extractor`
(MIT) ships an injected sniffer alongside its `Gw.dat` extractor.

Layer the shadow-server idea on top once capture works: feed your server the real CtoS stream and
diff its would-be output against the real server's while still forwarding the real answer. That is
HANDOFF §7's replay oracle at R0 instead of R2, open-loop, self-updating as you play. Then stop
forwarding message types that diff clean and answer them yourself, so the system stays playable
throughout and the project becomes incremental replacement rather than a cold start.
*Wasted if:* nothing obvious — this is required under every strategic option, it does not depend on
the language decision, and building it is how you find out how good the rest of the prior art
really is. **Build it first regardless of every other choice in this document.**
*Note:* the browser/WebSocket proxy route is attractive on paper but `gw_in_browser` cannot log in
(its auth paths are stubs), so it is a static-analysis asset, not a capture one. See §1.3.

**A2 — Stand up OpenTyria and see your character.** *(days · human)*
Public domain, ~25k lines, with agent, chat, inventory, item, map, pathfinding, party and title
modules plus SQLite persistence. Even if Rurik never ships a line of its code, building and
running it converts a pile of protocol theory into a working reference you can step through in a
debugger. *Wasted if:* it does not build against the 2026-04-30 client — in which case *why* is
itself the most valuable R1 finding available. *First step:* Probe 4.

**A3 — Reconcile the five existing opcode corpora into one build-stamped schema.** *(days · agent-farmable)*
Five independent catalogs now exist: OpenTyria's `msgdefs.c` + `opcodes.h` (public domain),
Headquarter's `opcodes.h` (MIT, declaring 60/40/194/487), `Py4GW_Reforged_Native`'s
`include/GW/common/opcodes.h`, the GWCA lineage, and GWLP-R-Utils' `PacketTemplates.xml` — **177 KB,
769 packets, 907 named entries** across all four directions **[sourced]**. They agree on values
where they overlap (`INSTANCE_LOAD_SPAWN_POINT = 0x0195` in three of them independently), which is
strong evidence they are all describing the same real protocol.

**Every schema revision must carry a client build id.** `MOVE_TO_COORD` drifted `0x003C` → `0x003E`
between builds, so an unstamped catalog is not merely stale, it is actively dangerous. The client's
own `template_size` (§1.2) is the arbiter, and disagreement with it is mechanically detectable —
which is exactly what makes this whole job safely delegable to agents.
*Wasted if:* nothing — this work is required under every option and gets cheaper as captures grow.

**A4 — Instrument the WASM client and take decoded ground truth, not bytes.** *(weeks · mixed)*
HANDOFF's model is record bytes → decode later → hope the decoder is right. Inverted: hook the
client's own per-opcode decode handlers and log *their outputs* — the client's own interpretation,
in its own structs, with `gensyms.py` naming the originating `.cpp`. Labelled ground truth on day
one instead of an undecoded pile. The same trick against static tables dumps all ~1,300 skill rows
with their rank scaling, moving R4b's numeric bootstrap from year two to week two without the
capture vault existing at all. *Wasted if:* Probe 3 fails. *First step:* Probe 3.

**A5 — Headless differential testing.** *(weeks · agent-farmable)*
The WASM client runs in a browser, and browsers are drivable by Playwright. That gives N scriptable
Guild Wars clients you can point at either the real service or your server, using the client's own
reactions as the correctness signal — diffing two clients' internal state rather than diffing
packets. This is the answer to "can the client be an oracle," and the harness is a browser
automation script rather than a bespoke engine.

**A6 — Agent-scale data entry with the client as referee.** *(months · agent-farmable)*
Seed from `build-wars/gw-skilldata` (MIT, pushed today). Cross-check every numeric field against
the client-extracted `GW::Skill` table — any disagreement is a hard conflict, not a judgement call.
For behaviour rather than numbers, drive a headless client to cast the skill on the live service
and diff against your engine's prediction. A row counts as verified only when the numbers agree and
the behaviour diffs clean. **No human reviews 1,300 rows**, and the pipeline cannot quietly fill
the database with plausible garbage, because every step has a mechanical referee.

**A7 — Author content into your own running client, with no server at all.** *(days · human, secondary account)*
GWCA exposes `EmulatePacket(Packet::StoC::PacketBase*)` **[sourced]**, and Py4GW independently
proved inbound packets can be rewritten in flight before the client materializes them. So you can
synthesize agents, dialogue and markers into your own client on real Ascalon geometry *before any
server exists*. This inverts the ladder's assumed dependency — R4-level semantic understanding
accumulates during R1–R3 instead of waiting behind them — and it directly attacks the handoff's own
admission that "you will not be able to use most of what you capture for two years."

It also turns §8's strongest law from a docstring into a call-site rule. "Before writing a
mechanism, ask whether the client even reads it" is currently enforced nowhere, which §8 itself says
makes it a wish. Enforce it: **for every packet you intend to emit, first prove via `EmulatePacket`
that the client changes observable behaviour when it receives one.**
*Caveat, stated plainly:* this is the highest ToS-exposure item here — in-process modification of a
live client on the real service. Secondary account, instanced content, supervised, never near
anything competitive. That is why it is A7 and not A1.
*First step:* re-emit a captured chat message and see it appear.

**A8 — Reframe the deliverable as the instrumentation toolchain.** *(continuous)*
The primary artifact becomes a documented, reproducible pipeline that turns the official WASM
client into a symbolized, hookable research target: fetch → verify → patch → detour → symbolize →
drive. It redistributes zero ArenaNet bytes, it is useful on day 30 rather than day 900, it is
what the GW1 RE scene currently lacks in one place, and the emulator becomes its flagship consumer
rather than its only justification. This directly addresses the plan's real failure mode — a
multi-year binary outcome with no interim value.

**Killed by scrutiny, recorded so nobody re-proposes them:** substituting a login DLL via
`-portaldll` (dead code); building on GWCA as a runtime dependency (closed-source and archived);
and hooking GWCA's typed StoC callbacks for raw capture (they fire on deserialized structs, so
unmapped opcodes are invisible rather than merely unparsed — the wrong layer for "record raw,
parse later").

The human is the bottleneck for exactly three things: anything that launches the game, anything
that judges whether the game *feels* right, and the account risk decisions. Everything else is
agent-farmable. **That sentence is the part of this section that held.**

**Human-only:** Probes 1, 2, 4. Playtesting. Deciding whether to use a secondary account.
**Agent-farmable:** the schema translation (A3), WASM tooling and symbolization (A4), the browser
harness (A5), the skill data pipeline (A6), Pre-Searing scope enumeration, and reading the mirrored
prior art.

- **Days 1–14** — Probes 1 and 2. Build and run OpenTyria (A2). In parallel, agents translate
  `msgdefs.c` into the schema and stand up codegen (A3). *Target: a character standing in a map.*
- **Days 15–45** — Probe 3. If it passes, the instrumented client becomes the capture harness (A1) and runs on
  every session from then on, including sessions played for fun. Begin the WASM symbolization
  pipeline (A4, A7).
- **Days 46–90** — Tape player (R1.5). Skill-table extraction and the referee'd data pipeline (A6).
  First shadow-server diffs on real traffic.

Capture still starts immediately and never stops — the wasting-asset argument is right. What
changes is that capture is now cheap enough to leave running rather than a project in itself.

## 6. Risks and hedges

| Risk | Hedge | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| A prior-art repo disappears | **Already happening** — `gwdevhub/gw_in_browser` 404s today while `gwnative` still names it upstream **[measured]**. `toolkit/mirror_priorart.py` clones the field into `vault/mirrors/` with a manifest recording each HEAD; run it monthly. | done |
| Service closes or changes | Record every live session from inside the instrumented client; zero marginal cost once built. *The hedge is unbuilt, so the risk is currently unhedged — and this row said "leave the proxy on", which was never a thing that could exist (§3 R0b).* | hours |
| **Client auto-patches over ground truth, and the DH keys rotate with it** | **This happened during the session that wrote this document.** The updater replaced `Gw.exe` (10,404,032 → 10,483,904 bytes) and `Gw.dat`, moved the DH struct from RVA `0x6843e8` to `0x6910d8`, and **changed both the prime and the server's public key**. ArenaNet rotates the Diffie-Hellman parameters per build — which is why Headquarter stores 107 server keys rather than one constant. Consequences: the client patch is a permanent recurring step, not a one-time one; every capture and schema revision must carry a build id (free, per §2); and re-snapshot *before* accepting an update prompt, never after. Both builds are now vaulted. | ongoing |
| **The client phones home when it crashes** | `Gw.exe` embeds Sentry: `SENTRY_DSN`, `sentry.native`, `getsentry`, `x-sentry-rate-limits` are all present **[measured]**. The working method here is inject, patch, malform, crash — so the client's own outbound reporting channel is a posture problem HANDOFF §9 never considered, since §9 reasons only about server-side visibility. Neutralise it before the first malformed packet: block the endpoint at the firewall or null the DSN in the patched copy. Minutes, and it belongs on the R0 checklist next to the vault snapshot. | minutes |
| **The captures contain the owner's real ArenaNet credential** | The client sends its saved password to our own webgate on every login, and `vault/captures/portal/*.jsonl` records it as base64 — `<Password>…</Password>`, reversible in one command **[measured 2026-08-04]**. It has never been in git: `vault/` was gitignored in the first commit, before any content existed, so there is no history to rewrite and "private repo" does not bear on it either way. **Owner's decision, 2026-08-05: the repo stays private, and a credential-scrubbing / anonymising pass is a gate before any public push** — not a change to capture fidelity now, since the whole method depends on recording what the client actually sent. Until then the vault is the only copy and stays local. | deferred, by decision |
| Account loss | Never automate on the primary account — now enforceable rather than aspirational, because a second account exists (§7 Q4). **The old reason given here was wrong and is replaced:** it said "the proxy posture — watching your own traffic — is milder than injecting a DLL", but A1's instrument is Headquarter, a third-party client that logs into the live service. That is not a proxy. **SOURCED:** *MDY v. Blizzard* turned on unattended automation of gameplay, and Warden targeted automated play *patterns* rather than the presence of third-party code — which is why addons and injected tooling coexisted with it for years, and why `HANDOFF.md` can record that "GWToolbox is tolerated precisely because of how it has behaved". So the control is behavioural: human cadence, human hours, one client, never in a competitive context. §6.2 | one account |
| A client update invalidates months of offset work | Choose WASM: the module bytes are the code and offsets come from the module | free, if you switch |
| Two years with nothing playable | A2 and R1.5 both target a visible result inside 90 days | — |


### 6.2 Live capture, and the two client configurations

§7 Q4 authorizes automation against the live service. That breaks an assumption every
safety control in this repo was built on — that **nothing ever talks to ArenaNet** — and
the controls now have to distinguish two configurations rather than forbid one.

**"Patched" is not the property the rule wants.** `make_custom_client.py` applies four
modifications and only ONE disqualifies a client from touching the real service:

| Patch | Effect on a live login |
|---|---|
| **Diffie-Hellman triple** (generator, prime, server public B) | **DISQUALIFYING.** The client derives the ARC4 key locally from our `B`; ArenaNet's AuthSrv keys from theirs. The result is not a clean refusal, it is **a stream of garbage frames delivered to ArenaNet's auth server** — the mirror image of the `AUTH_CMSG has no opcode 26763` failure a stock client produces against us, which RUNBOOK already calls "exactly the kind of malformed traffic worth not sending". |
| Updater kill switch | Harmless, and **wanted** — it pins the build against an update that would replace our ground truth. |
| `CreateMutexA` guard NOPed | Harmless, and **wanted** — multiple instances is what capture at scale needs. |
| Mutex renamed | Harmless. A client-side fingerprint change, noted only because it is visible. |

So the non-negotiable is restated as **a client carrying OUR DH parameters must never
reach the real service** — three quarters of the patch set is fine on both sides.

**The sharpest hazard is not the DH patch, because the DH patch fails late.** Login is
three stages (§1.6). The DH substitution touches Stage B only. A patched client launched
at the live service with no `-portal` completes a **real Stage A portal login, with the
owner's autofilled primary credential**, and only then fails at Stage B. The
account-visible event happens before the patch matters.

**What must be true before the first live run**, none of which is true today:

1. 🔶 **A live-capture client is a separate build** — unpatched DH, with the updater and
   mutex patches. **The build exists as of 2026-08-06**, so does the filing that keeps it
   apart from the loopback one, and so does the launch gate. **What is left is a 4 GB
   file copy.**

   *The artifact.* `make_custom_client.py --no-dh-patch` produces it — stock DH, updater
   off, multi-instance on — so it is reproducible after the next ArenaNet update rather
   than assembled by hand. It verifies the negative (the DH struct is byte-identical to
   the input) and then classifies the result against `vault/keys/dh_params_*.txt`, which
   a different tool dumped on a different day.

   *The filing, which is a safety control and not tidiness.* Whose DH a build carries
   decides where it may point, so the vault is split on exactly that:

   | | ours | stock |
   |---|---|---|
   | staged | `vault/client-patched/` `Gw.custom.<tag>.exe` | `vault/client-patched-live/` `Gw.live.<tag>.exe` |
   | assembled | `vault/run/<tag>/` | `vault/run-live/<tag>/` |
   | posture | loopback only, caged | live only, **cannot** be caged |

   `toolkit/clientpatch/dhbuild.py` answers `ours`/`stock`/`unknown` from the bytes;
   the patcher refuses to write either kind into the other's directory; `make_run_dir.py`
   classifies even an explicitly passed `--patched`; `test_handshake.py` selects the same
   way and refuses a wrong artifact *before* spawning a server. `python
   toolkit/clientpatch/dhbuild.py` audits the whole vault in one command.

   *Why all of that, from one afternoon.* The live build first landed **inside**
   `vault/client-patched/`, where two tools picked "the patched client" with
   `sorted(exes)[-1]` and `l` sorts after `c`. `test_handshake.py` went red with four
   failures and 8-of-13 checks, none of which was a crypto regression and all of which
   read as one; `make_run_dir.py` would have assembled a client that cannot key into
   `vault/run/`, which `drive_client.assert_safe` treats as the set of legal loopback
   targets. Filename order is not a safety property. `test_dhbuild.py` rebuilds that
   directory with the stock build sorting last *and* newest, and requires the right
   answer.

   *The launch gate.* Launch safety is no longer "is this client caged" but a **binding
   between the binary and the target**, read out of the bytes:
   `cage.assert_launch_safe(exe, host)` enforces all four cells, and `test_cage.py`
   proves each fires. **ours→loopback** needs a verified cage; **ours→live** and
   **stock→loopback** are refused; **stock→live uncaged** is *allowed*, because a gate
   that refuses everything is an outage rather than a control — and refusing the
   authorized run is how someone ends up forking a driver without the guards. This
   replaces whole-file hashing for the safety question: `pinned.py` knows exactly one
   patched SHA-256, so every client the patcher builds read as `unknown` and was refused,
   and its single `patched` bucket held four independent modifications when only the DH
   substitution decides anything.
   One thing fell out of building it. A **missing** `-portal` is not neutral — the client
   falls back to its compiled-in ArenaNet endpoint — so `intended_target()` resolves an
   absent flag to the *live* target, which means §6.2's sharpest hazard (a DH-patched
   client launched with no `-portal` completing a real Stage A login) is caught by a
   measurement rather than by a rule about flags.

   *What is still open.* `vault/run-live/<build>/` holds the exe and the DLLs but **not
   `Gw.dat`** — a running client held the source open exclusively — and `assert_safe`
   refuses an incomplete run directory. Close every client, re-run
   `make_run_dir.py --live`, and A1 has a legal launch target. Nothing further has to be
   designed for it.

   *Known duplication, being resolved.* `dhbuild.py` and `buildid.py` were written the
   same afternoon by two sessions for the same job. `dhbuild` owns selection, staging and
   the hostile-filename regression; `buildid` proves **B == g^b mod p** before calling a
   build ours, which is what makes `ours` a check rather than a label — `dhbuild` asserts
   that guarantee in its docstring and never tests it. They are merged in the commit
   after this one, `dhbuild` surviving.
2. **The cage is per-client and its removal is elevated.** `isolate_client.ps1` pins a
   client to loopback by program path, so a live client cannot be caged — there is no
   partial setting. `cage-off` was reachable unelevated through
   `toolkit/harness/admin.py`, and `-Remove` takes down **every** cage on the machine;
   removed from the allowlist 2026-08-06, so uncaging now costs a UAC prompt.
3. ✅ **Launch sites check for a cage.** Done 2026-08-06. `toolkit/clientpatch/cage.py`
   asks the Windows Firewall whether *this* binary has both rules — the loopback allow
   AND the broad block, because an orphaned allow looks like cleanup and permits
   everything — and both launch sites (`drive_client.py`, `session.py`) assert it
   independently rather than one trusting the other. It classifies the binary through
   `pinned.identify()` and **refuses `unknown`**, which is the case that matters next:
   `make_custom_client` generates fresh DH parameters, so the next patched copy has a
   hash nobody has recorded. Fail-closed throughout — an undeterminable firewall is a
   refusal, not permission. `test_cage.py` proves all four refusals.
   *The state that prompted it: two patched binaries on disk, one (`…-probe`) uncaged
   for a day, and `assert_safe` waved it through because it checks the path and the
   flags, both of which an uncaged copy passes. Both are caged as of 2026-08-06.*
4. ✅ **The automation selects its account.** Done 2026-08-06.
   `toolkit/harness/accounts.py` decides by target: **loopback gets a synthetic
   credential and no real account at all**, because `webgate.py` says yes to anyone —
   its own comment says so — so a real login there bought nothing and is how the owner's
   password reached 206 capture records. A non-loopback target must name an account and
   that account must carry `automation: true` in `vault/keys/accounts.json`. The flag is
   **opt-in**, so an account with no flag — the primary — is refused by default rather
   than by remembering to exclude it; forgetting is safe, which a blocklist cannot
   promise. `-email`/`-password` are the client's own flags **[measured, argtable.py,
   build 38797]**; passing a password in an argv is visible in the local process list and
   is accepted deliberately over leaving autofill in charge, and `redact()` keeps it out
   of both launch sites' prints and the run manifest. `test_accounts.py` proves six
   refusals including the primary one.
5. ✅ **Live records are distinguishable from loopback ones.** Done 2026-08-06.
   `toolkit/origin.py` classifies every capture **ours / live / unknown**, and the third
   value is the design: a two-valued scheme forces an unstamped file to be called one or
   the other, and whichever default you pick is wrong exactly when it matters — the
   first live capture written by a tool that forgot to stamp. `authsrv.py`'s Recorder
   now writes an `origin` record as the first line of every session; unstamped legacy
   files infer OURS only from all-loopback peers **plus** our own session markers, and
   nothing ever infers LIVE, because `captures/patcher/` holds public addresses too.
   The guard that matters is `require_single()`: `test_movement_fidelity.py` pools every
   game-channel capture into one number, and a live file in that pool would blend two
   oracles invisibly. **MEASURED: 424 files, 341 ours, 83 unknown (patcher and short
   sessions), 0 live — and 113 of 113 game-channel files are ours**, so it refuses
   nothing today and refuses the first one that appears.

**Four defects the build turned up, all of them in the controls themselves.** Recorded
because every one was invisible to the thing meant to catch it:

* **Both launch sites had been unimportable since the cage guard landed.**
  `drive_client.py` did `import cage` with `clientpatch/` not on `sys.path`, so
  `drive_client.py` and `session.py` both raised `ModuleNotFoundError` at module level
  — the guard existed and the file holding it could not load. `test_harness.py` catches
  it on the first run; it is named in `CLAUDE.md`'s suite list and was not among the
  tests run when that suite was last reported green. Fixed, and `test_harness.py` now
  passes 36 checks with its floor tightened from a read-off 26 to the measured total.
* **`launch_caged.ps1` opened the cage on the daily path, months after it stopped
  needing to.** Its own comment ends "The real fix is to stop the updater from running
  at all, so the cage never has to open"; that fix shipped and is applied by default,
  and `RUNBOOK` went on naming the script as step 4 anyway. Opening the cage leaks by
  construction — firewall rules are evaluated at connection **establishment**, and
  Windows offers no supported way to tear down an established TCP connection. It now
  asks `buildid.py` and refuses any build carrying the kill switch. Its rule lookup was
  also broken: it matched an exact display name while `isolate_client.ps1` appends
  `[<tag>]`, so it found only rules left by an older version of that script.
* **`drive_client.py` wrote the plaintext password into `report.json`** while the console
  print of the same argv two lines later was redacted — the precise failure
  `accounts.redact`'s docstring says it exists to prevent. Found before a real automation
  account had ever used it. `redact_for_file()` now covers the address too, because
  `scrub_captures.py` matches JSON **keys** and in a manifest the address is a **value**
  inside an argv list, so a tree-wide scrub would have walked straight past it.
* **`test_handshake.py` selected its client with `sorted(exes)[-1]`.** `Gw.live.` sorts
  after `Gw.custom.`, so the first live-capture build in the directory silently became
  "the patched client" and the test reported that client and server derived different
  keys — a true statement about the wrong binary, and indistinguishable from a broken
  handshake. It now selects on `dh_verdict == ours`, which is the property it actually
  needs. `make_run_dir.py` had the same latent bug and was fixed before it could fire.

**R0b's deliverable was wrong, and is fixed.** §3 called it "proxy capture of a real
session", which cannot work: the channel is DH-keyed end to end and a proxy holds neither
private exponent — the same fact that forces us to patch the client to talk to our own
server. Re-specified 2026-08-06 in §3's rung table and in §4's structural note as capture
from inside a client we control, before the rung is started rather than after it fails.
The property the proxy idea was chosen for survives: it is still not an in-process DLL
hooking addresses that move with every build.

### 6.1 The derivation register

Which upstream each module's *code or layout* came from, and what that upstream grants.
It exists because on 2026-08-05 `toolkit/mapdata/gwdat.py` landed declaring itself a port
of `gw-preservation/fileserver-utils` — **the day after §1.1 wrote "never copy from them"
about exactly that repository** — and sat in the running server's dependency chain until
the 2026-08-06 review found it. The rule was in the plan; nothing was checking.

**SOURCED:** the model is ReactOS's post-2006 contributor taint register, not a Phoenix
clean room. A clean room is two teams, a specification wall and an audit trail; that is
disproportionate for one owner and a 356-line decompressor. A register is a table you
keep honest.

| Module | Derived from | Upstream grants | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `toolkit/mapdata/gwdat.py` | GuildWarsMapBrowser `SourceFiles/xentax.cpp` | custom licence — permissive, but **requires a repo link and visible credit**; it is *not* MIT | ✅ re-derived 2026-08-06, attributed in `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`, and the six-table correspondence is **checked** by `test_gwdat.py` against the vaulted mirror |
| `toolkit/mapdata/pathmap.py` | GuildWarsMapBrowser ImHex FFNA pattern | same | ✅ attributed 2026-08-06, same notice |
| `schema/messages.json` | OpenTyria `code/msgdefs.c` | Unlicense — public domain, no obligation | ✅ credited anyway; `overrides.json` keeps our corrections separable |
| `content/items.toml` `starter_hammer` | OpenTyria `GmDefaultArmors.c` | Unlicense | ✅ row records source `opentyria`, and records that no capture corroborates it |
| `toolkit/mapdata/archive.py` | OpenTyria — the archive magic's byte order | Unlicense | ✅ cited in the module |
| `content/npcs.toml` `hatcher`, `content/maps.toml` ids | gw-preservation — **all rights reserved** | nothing | ✅ verified-only: each row records what it was checked against in our own artifacts, and `toolkit/content.py` **refuses to load** one that does not |
| `toolkit/authsrv/probes.py` ALLEGIANCE constants | four-byte tokens `'play'`, `'nonc'`, `'mons'` | — | ✅ confirmed against our own client; **JUDGEMENT:** short functional identifiers of this kind are facts about the wire, not expression |
| `toolkit/mapdata/atex.py` | nothing — authored from our own record walk | — | ✅ checked 2026-08-06, clean |
| `toolkit/mapdata/dxt1.py` | nothing — DXT1/BC1 is a publicly documented format | — | ✅ checked 2026-08-06, clean |
| `toolkit/mapdata/datwrite.py`, `datplan.py` | nothing declared | — | ✅ checked 2026-08-06, no derivation statement and none needed |

**The rule this table encodes:** before a module takes a layout, an algorithm or a table
from any upstream, add its row *first*. If the upstream grants nothing, the only
permitted use is to verify a value we derived ourselves — which is what
`toolkit/content.py` now enforces at load rather than leaving to memory.

Two things this register deliberately does **not** claim. It is not a statement that no
contributor ever read an unlicensed repository — reading them is explicitly allowed and
is how several of our own bugs were found. And it says nothing about ArenaNet: the
provenance gate is separate, absolute, and covers bytes rather than derivation.

## 7. Open questions for the owner

**Q1. Build on the existing servers, or learn from them and stay independent?**
*Recommendation: independent codebase, treating OpenTyria and gw-preservation as published answer
keys for R1–R3 and Headquarter as the capture instrument. Vendor nothing except possibly
OpenTyria's public-domain schema.* The reasons to refuse adoption are concrete: OpenTyria implements
only about 8–9% of the opcode space, has 2 unit tests, 6 hardcoded maps, **zero content tables** in
its schema, an empty "Known issues" section and a HEAD that has not moved since February while its
author commits weekly elsewhere; and `gw-preservation` carries no license at all, pins a
pre-Reforged client version, and coordinates entirely off GitHub. Neither is a platform. Both are
one person's exploration.

*The counterargument is genuinely strong and should be recorded honestly.* You want R4c and R5.
Everything below that is plumbing you did not ask for. OpenTyria suggests a competent person needs
something like eighteen months to reach R3 — and Rurik would redo it in another language without
that person's accumulated protocol knowledge, so plausibly slower. That is a large slice of a
multi-year solo budget spent re-deriving something already public domain, before writing a line of
the thing you actually want.

*The recommendation is therefore contingent, not principled.* It rests on one testable assumption:
that a working reference implementation plus a solved crypto scheme plus five agreeing opcode
catalogs turns R1–R3 from research into transcription. If that assumption fails, adoption was right
and independence costs a year.

**The hedge costs nothing: build the capture harness (A1) first, before committing either way.** It
is required under every option, it is the wasting asset, it does not depend on the language
decision, and building it is precisely how you find out how good the prior art really is. Defer
this decision until it has recorded its first sessions.

**Q2. Is the WASM client the primary target?** *Recommendation: yes if Probe 3 passes.* It is
better instrumented, better symbolized, patch-resilient, and drivable by browser automation. Keep
the x86 client as the playtest client.

**Q3. Does the provenance gate survive contact?** §9 says "zero ArenaNet bytes in the repo, ever,"
but R0 vaults `Gw.exe` and `Gw.dat` and every schema derives from them. *Recommendation:* restate
the gate as a **derivation graph with a gitignored `build/`** — every derived artifact regenerates
from a documented fetch of a freely downloadable client. That is a stronger and more honest
formulation than a prohibition needing constant qualification, and it matches the owner's own point
that the client is available to anyone.

**Q4. A secondary account for automation?** ✅ **CLOSED 2026-08-06, by the owner.** A second
account is bought. **Automation against the live ArenaNet service on that account is
authorized** — and it "shouldn't be the go-to test mode". Both halves are binding: the
default loop stays hand-driven against our own server, and live automation is a mode you
enter deliberately for a capture campaign, never a convenience left switched on. The
conditions and the machinery that has to change first are §6.2. **A1 is unblocked; it is
not yet safe to run.**

**Q5. Does Pre-Searing remain the finish line?** *Recommendation: yes, unchanged.*

## 8. Immediate next actions

**Status lives in §3, not here.** This list is what to *do*; §3 is where the project *is*.
Cross off an item in the same commit that lands it — on 2026-08-06 this list still opened
with "R2 — the game server" thirty-two hours after R2 was standing in a map, and `CLAUDE.md`
calls this the live list, so a cold session was being handed a finished task as its next one.

**Done since this list was written** — kept to one line each so it stays a plan and not a diary.
R2 (`aedc214`), movement and collision (`885d05d`, `a97c7c4`), the client's packet-format
tables dumped and reconciled against our catalog at 477/477 (`toolkit/schema/test_catalog.py`,
which retires old item 3), the skill table extracted and joined to the wiki by id
(`toolkit/clientscan/skilltable.py`, which retires old item 6), a hostile NPC that can be
attacked, killed and revived, and the content store (`content/*.toml`, `501698b`).

1. **Build the capture harness (A1).** *Started 2026-08-06.* Every one of the 424 captures in
   the vault is Rurik talking to Rurik; **not one byte is ArenaNet's**, so R0b is unmet and
   R1.5 and R4c's original criterion are both blocked behind it. §4-A1 says "build it first
   regardless of every other choice in this document" and it had been second on this list
   since the list was written.
   **Done:** the live-capture build exists and the launch gate binds a binary to a target
   (§6.2 precondition 1). **Next, in order:** close every client and finish
   `make_run_dir.py --live` so there is a complete launch target; then the capture itself.
   Start from Headquarter's headless-client approach; read `gw-preservation/network-logger`
   for the in-client route.
   *What that capture has to produce is not obvious and is worth settling before writing it:*
   `origin.py`'s docstring already defers to "a future live-capture tool", and today **no
   client-side capture path exists at all** — the only `Recorder` in the tree is inside
   `authsrv.py` and fires only when a client connects to a listener we run. Byte-for-byte
   replay is also not achievable from today's captures: s2c ciphertext is never written to
   the `.raw` sidecar, and the `sent` events that would let it be reconstructed are logged
   **outside** the send lock, so the recorded order can differ from the wire order under
   thread contention. Fix that before it becomes the only recording of the real server.
2. **Spec the row format before the sniffer.** The half nobody owns: even with tape, nothing
   turns a capture into a content row. `content/*.toml` now gives that output a shape, so the
   job is a capture→row compiler, not a parser. **SOURCED:** this is the difference between
   WowPacketParser and a packet logger, and TrinityCore's whole 3.3.5a world database exists
   because that pipeline ran while retail was on 3.3.5a. Target the first monster row, not a
   complete zone.
3. **Finish R4a.** Nothing swings back. The player cannot die. The agent table
   `studies/enemy/PLAN.md` §7.2 asks for is the prerequisite, and it should read its NPCs from
   `content/npcs.toml` rather than minting constants.
4. **Enumerate Pre-Searing** — [studies/presearing/MANIFEST.md](studies/presearing/MANIFEST.md).
   It is what makes R4b and R4c countable (§3.2). Keep it current as content rows land.
5. **Build OpenTyria** (`vault/mirrors/ldufr__OpenTyria`) and connect a *patched copy* of the
   client. Never patch `C:\gw`. Fastest route to understanding the whole stack end to end.
   *Note: its value has dropped — the assumption it was hedging (that R1–R3 would be research)
   was tested and did not hold. See §7 Q1.*
6. **Read `gw-preservation/server`'s pathing and instance definitions** — 397 maps and a real
   `Gw.dat` navmesh. Read only: no licence means all rights reserved, and `toolkit/content.py`
   now refuses a row citing them that does not record what we verified it against.
7. **Run Probe 3** (`vault/mirrors/shiburito__gw_in_browser`) for offline WASM analysis only —
   not for live capture, per §1.3. It is the only thing gating §7 Q2, which has been open since
   the plan was written; give it a date and a default answer of "no" if it does not run by then.
8. **The C# server core.** *Contested, and open.* This item used to read "install a .NET SDK if
   the C# server core survives Q1/Q2". Since then ~18,000 lines of working server have been
   written in Python, `CLAUDE.md` binds `toolkit/` to the standard library, and the 2026-08-06
   review measured the transport at ~7,000 encode+encrypt messages per 50 ms tick against an R4
   budget near 60 — so performance was never the constraint. The review's recommendation is to
   strike this item and record a closed decision. **That is the owner's call and it has not been
   made**; until it is, no new server code should presume either answer.
9. **Re-run `toolkit/mirror_priorart.py`** monthly. Repos in this ecosystem vanish; one already
   has.
