# What the client sends, and why it sent it

`schema/messages.json` carries field layouts for **194 `GAME_CMSG` opcodes and names for
none of them**. `authsrv.py` names 11 by hand at its dispatch. This file is the record of
opcodes named from evidence — a human performing a named action while the server marks
the window it happened in (`toolkit/authsrv/labelrun.py`, procedure in `RUNBOOK.md`).

Labels are the vocabulary in [../character/FINDINGS.md](../character/FINDINGS.md).
The tape runs that made this possible are [../tape/FINDINGS.md](../tape/FINDINGS.md).

## 1. The run

**2026-08-10, capture `gamesrv/authsrv-20260810T151946-c1.jsonl`.** The Lakeside County
tape (`:64103`) played to completion, then 18 prompted steps. Movement was dead — nothing
answers under a tape ([../tape/FINDINGS.md](../tape/FINDINGS.md) T6) — so the operator
pressed inputs into a frozen world.

**Both controls clean: `idle_a` 0 messages, `idle_b` 0 messages.** The operator moved the
mouse during `idle_a` and it sent nothing. Every attribution below rests on those two rows.

Two operator corrections are folded in below and both change what may be claimed:

* **Clear Target was unbound.** The prompt said "press Escape"; the operator clicked the
  nameplate button. `0x0028` therefore **cannot** be attributed to a key.
* **This map is full of Plague Worms**, which burrow — a standard GW mechanic that hides
  them from targeting. That is almost certainly what `0x00C1 [285]` is doing in the
  `target_clear` window, and it is what the tape's agent-id churn actually was.

## 2. Named from evidence

### C1 — `0x0046` field 1 is a SKILL ID, not a bar slot. OBSERVED, twice.

```
skill_1  ->  0x0046 [32838, 153, 0, 284, 0]
skill_2  ->  0x0046 [32838, 105, 0, 284, 0]
skill_8  ->  (nothing)
```

153 and 105, from slots **1 and 2**. A slot index would read 0 and 1. The client's own
tables resolve them to `'Vampiric Gaze'` and `'Deathly Swarm'`
([../tape/FINDINGS.md](../tape/FINDINGS.md) T4), which are the skills the recorded
character actually carries.

This is now **two independent witnesses on different days**: an unplanned five minutes on
the Ascalon tape, and a prompted step here. Field 3 is the target agent id (284, the
agent targeted two steps earlier).

**And the client validates slot occupancy locally.** Slot 8 is empty on that bar and
pressing 8 sent *nothing at all* — the client does not ask the server about a skill it
does not have.

### C2 — `0x0064` is chat, it carries the text verbatim, and EMOTES GO THROUGH IT. OBSERVED.

```
chat_say     ->  0x0064 [32868,   0, "!rurik one"]
emote_dance  ->  0x0064 [32868, 284, "/dance"]
```

The operator typed `rurik one`; the client sent `!rurik one` — it **prefixes the channel
itself** (`!` = all). This is the one step whose payload was predictable in advance, and
it matched.

`/dance` went out on the **same opcode**, as literal text. So emotes are not a separate
message type on the wire: they are chat lines the server parses. That is a real
simplification for our server, and it was not predicted.

Field 1 differs — 0 for chat, 284 for the emote — and **why is UNVERIFIED**. 284 was the
targeted agent, but the target was also 284 during `chat_say`, so "current target" does
not explain it. Do not build on this field.

### C3 — `0x00C1` is target-select, and `0` clears it. CORROBORATED.

```
target_tab    ->  0x00C1 [276]  0x00C1 [273]  0x00C1 [274]     (Tab pressed three times)
target_clear  ->  0x00C1 [285]  0x00C1 [0]
attack        ->  0x00C1 [284]  then  0x0026 [284]
```

Tab cycles: three presses, three different agents, all of them worms. The clear form
carries agent id **0**, which was predicted from 2026-08-10's stray observation and
confirmed here.

### C4 — `0x0026` is attack/interact, and it is DISTINCT from target-select. OBSERVED.

`0x0026 [32806, 284, 0]` in the `attack` window, immediately after `0x00C1 [284]`. Two
opcodes, one action: select, then act on the selection.

Whether `0x0026` is *attack* specifically or a general *interact* remains **UNVERIFIED** —
the `interact_npc` step was cut from the script, and `gateway` (§3) sent no interact at
all. One labelled run separating a hostile from a friendly click would settle it.

### C5 — `0x003D` field 4 is a DIRECTION, not a position. OBSERVED, and checkable.

Movement was dead, so the position field never changed across the whole run — every
`0x003D` carries the same `(-8088.86, -6705.80)`. The fourth field changed constantly, and
**its magnitude is very nearly constant**:

```
( 766.82,    0.00)  |v| = 766.816       (-194.27,  742.84)  |v| = 767.819
( 764.93,  -11.42)  |v| = 765.018       (-642.94,  418.44)  |v| = 767.111
(-280.79, -713.55)  |v| = 766.805       (-766.76,  -23.33)  |v| = 767.111
( 592.22, -487.11)  |v| = 766.812       (-758.95,   96.17)  |v| = 765.018
                       spread over 8 samples: 2.80 on ~766.8, or 0.37%
```

A fixed-length vector that rotates is a **heading**. This CORROBORATES the UPSTREAM name
`TURN_TO_DIRECTION` from a property the schema itself does not state — and it is the kind
of check the artifact can refute, since a position field would have wandered with the
character. (It could not have: the character could not move. That is what makes the
constancy meaningful rather than circular.)

Why the magnitude is ~766.8 rather than 1.0 is **NOT FOUND**.

### C6 — `0x0040` is FLOATS, and the schema types them as dwords. OBSERVED.

`camera` predicted SILENCE and was **refuted** — 8 × `0x0040` plus one `0x003D` and one
`0x0047`. Reinterpreting the two dword fields as IEEE-754 float32:

| raw | as float | raw | as float |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x00000000` | `0.0` | `0x3F800000` | `1.0` |
| `0xBFF90C83` | `-1.9457` | `0x3F800000` | `1.0` |
| `0xFF800000` | **`-inf`** | `0x3F800000` | `1.0` |
| `0xBF3035EA` | `-0.6883` | `0x3F800000` | `1.0` |
| `0x7F800000` | **`+inf`** | `0x3F800000` | `1.0` |

Field 2 is **exactly 1.0 in all ten samples**. Field 1 reaches **±infinity**, which an
angle in radians never does but a ratio — a slope, a tangent — does exactly when it passes
through vertical. That is a hint, not a finding: what field 1 *means* is **UNVERIFIED**.

What is actionable now: `schema/messages.json` types both as `dword`, and they are
floats. That is a concrete `overrides.json` correction with evidence behind it.

### C7 — Camera movement is NOT purely client-side. OBSERVED, prediction refuted.

The prediction was that rotating the camera sends nothing. It sent ten messages. Compare
`inventory` and `map_open`, which predicted silence and **got** silence — so the client
is not simply chatty, and the camera is genuinely different from opening a window.

### C8 — Two more opcodes witnessed, weakly labelled.

* `0x004F [32847, 0, 4, 1]` from dragging one inventory item to another slot. Field
  layout unread; **UNVERIFIED** beyond "inventory move sends this".
* `0x0032 [32818, 1]` from switching weapon sets. The `1` plausibly indexes the set.
  **UNVERIFIED.**
* `0x0028 [32808]`, three times, in the `target_clear` window — **no payload at all**.
  The operator clicked a UI button rather than pressing a key, so this cannot be
  attributed to Escape or to any keystroke. Witnessed, unexplained.

## 3. Corrections to earlier claims

### The keepalive is NOT an unconditional timer. Corrects [../tape/FINDINGS.md](../tape/FINDINGS.md) T5.

T5 said `0x0009` fires "at a dead-regular 5.0 s cadence... independent of anything on
screen". The second half is right and the implication was wrong. In this capture:

```
0x0009: 37 in the whole file, 0 inside any labelled step
```

All 37 landed **during the tape**. The moment the recording stopped and the server went
silent, the client stopped sending it — through three and a half minutes of active play.
So it is not a heartbeat the client emits regardless; it is tied to server traffic.
Whether it is a reply, or a timer the server's messages reset, is **UNVERIFIED**.

### The agent-id churn was worms burrowing. Refines [../tape/FINDINGS.md](../tape/FINDINGS.md) T3.

T3 recorded agent 281 created and removed 19 times in 186 s, and 19 of 45 ids reused, as
corroboration that a removed id is not poisoned (D1). The operator identifies the
mechanic: **Plague Worms burrow**, and GW hides a burrowed creature from targeting.

D1's conclusion stands and gets sharper. This is not spawn-and-death churn — it is one
creature going away and coming back, and **ArenaNet hands it the same agent id every
time**. `WORLD_REMOVE_AGENT` is how the client is told a creature is untargetable, not
only how it is told one died. Our server's `remove_agent` is therefore on the critical
path for a mechanic we have not modelled at all.

### `gateway` sent no zone message. OBSERVED.

Walking into the exit produced only movement (`0x003D` ×4, `0x003E` ×2, `0x0047`). There
is no client-initiated "take me to the next map" message in that window — consistent with
the transfer being server-initiated, and with the tape's silence meaning nothing could
start it.

## 4. The count

Before this run, **15** `GAME_CMSG` opcodes had ever been witnessed from a real client.
This run adds **five**: `0x0028`, `0x0032`, `0x0040`, `0x004F`, `0x0064`. Of the 20 now witnessed, this file names **six with evidence** (C1–C6) and
leaves the rest witnessed-but-unexplained.

194 opcodes have layouts. 20 have been seen. That ratio is the argument for running this
again.

---

## 5. Next

1. **A second labelled run with the gaps closed** — `interact_npc` (settles C4), a
   friendly vs hostile click, `/sit` against `/dance` (does a persistent emote differ?),
   several more skill slots, and a merchant. The script is cheap to extend and each run
   is six minutes.
2. **Write C1, C3, C5 and C6 into `schema/overrides.json`** with this capture cited —
   particularly C6's float typing, which is a decoding bug in every reader we have.
3. **Model burrowing** (§3). It is the first GW mechanic we have direct evidence for that
   our server has no concept of, and it runs entirely through `0x0020`/`0x0021`, which are
   already implemented.
