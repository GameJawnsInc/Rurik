"""Scripted one-packet experiments, fired at our own client after it spawns.

studies/character/FINDINGS.md ends with a probe queue: a set of questions where
all read-only research is exhausted and only the client can settle them. Reading
more mirrors cannot help, because for several of these every mirror is the same
witness wearing different clothes. The client is the last court.

Each probe is a short sequence of packets with a stated question, a stated
prediction, and an instruction about what to look at. The prediction matters: a
probe that does not say in advance what it expects can be rationalised after the
fact into agreeing with whatever happened, which is how we ended up with three
comments in authsrv.py stating inference as fact.

Usage, once the character is standing in the map:

    python toolkit/authsrv/authsrv.py --probe level
    python toolkit/authsrv/authsrv.py --list-probes

The server runs the sequence after the spawn burst, prints what to watch for
before each step, and records every packet to the capture as usual. Nothing here
touches anything but our own loopback client.

WHY DELAYS. The steps are spaced so a person can see one result before the next
arrives. A probe that fires three packets in 50 ms tells you only what the last
one did.
