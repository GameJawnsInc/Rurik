"""MOVECODE-1z-t (KBD_SYNC): keep the client's WORLD-0 copy near the body.

What this file is for. The arc's other movement tests pin the arms that
already existed; this one pins the behaviour that ships by default from
2026-09-03 and the derivation each of its three constants came from. The
VERDICT on the behaviour is an operator run with `agenttap.py --agents 1` --
a test written against my own hypothesis is two of our components agreeing
(CLAUDE.md, and [[operator-symptoms-close-on-runs]]). What this file CAN
refuse to let rot:

  * the lead's LENGTH is ours and its DIRECTION is the client's -- the
    distinction that separates this from `--heading-grant`'s graveyard, where
    the ray was aimed from `state["pos"]`, a model belief;
  * the band refusal (refuse, never clamp) and the fallback it degrades to;
  * the composition -- D1_LEAD owns the slot when both are set, so a
    --d1-lead run still measures REALFIX-A2 and not a mixture;
  * the three terms' independent off switches, so ONE run can convict ONE
    term (sec.29's lesson: shipping two defaults into one run convicts the
    pair and clears neither);
  * the burst ORDER, which is retail's own grammar and not a preference:
    0x0025 then 0x002B then 0x0029, with 0x0029 last in every shape that
    contains it (3,023 of 3,071 live bursts, zero counter-examples);
  * and the registered prediction, so the run that closes this cannot be
    rationalised into agreeing with it afterwards.

The stop echo's own wire shape is pinned next door, in test_position_trust
section "THE STOP ARM, BOTH REGIMES", because that is where the arm it
replaced was pinned and a guard is worth more sitting where the thing it
guards against used to live.
